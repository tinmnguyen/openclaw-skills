# LinkedIn Writer

Writes LinkedIn posts that sound like you, not a content robot. Human voice, real stories, proper formatting.

## What It Does

- Writes posts using proven formats (story, contrarian, list, lesson)
- Uses hook formulas that stop the scroll
- Formats for LinkedIn's algorithm (short paragraphs, engagement drivers)
- Matches your voice and tone

## Usage

"Write a LinkedIn post about how we lost our biggest client and what it taught us about customer success."
